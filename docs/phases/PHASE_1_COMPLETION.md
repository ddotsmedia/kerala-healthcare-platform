## Smoke checklist — ALL 8 PASS

| # | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/ml/doctors` renders Malayalam | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | `/ml/doctors/[slug]` renders + JSON-LD | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | `/ml/hospitals/[slug]` renders | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | search "cardiology" → cardiologists | ✅ PASS (4) |
| 5 | search "thrissur" → Thrissur providers | ✅ PASS (2) |
| 6 | manglish "vaidyan"/"kaliveedu" → results | ✅ PASS (1 each) |
| 7 | admin queue loads + approve works | ✅ PASS |
| 8 | doctor edits bio → visible publicly | ✅ PASS (login via stand-in; real auth = Phase 2) |
| + | Lighthouse SEO ≥ 90 (doctor profile) | ✅ PASS (100) |

**All 8 smoke items pass.** (Item 8's login uses the `PORTAL_DEMO_DOCTOR_ID` stand-in; OTP/JWT login is Phase 2.)

## Final quality gates
- `pnpm build` — web, admin, portal all exit 0.
- `pnpm lint` — web, admin, portal: no ESLint warnings or errors.

---

## Deviations & deferrals (all logged in BLOCKERS.md)
- **`healthcare_providers`** = a VIEW over `doctors` (additive reconciliation; no rename/drop). `doctors` is the physical table; `type` carries provider types.
- **Encryption:** hospital/doctor phone/email kept ENCRYPTED (`*_enc`) per SECURITY.md instead of the spec's plaintext fields.
- **Auth/RBAC:** admin RBAC + portal login are placeholders until Phase 2 (OTP/JWT). REST routes guard via `x-khp-role` header for now.
- **Path:** apps use `app/` (not the spec's `src/app/`), consistent with the existing tree.
- **Not added** (not required by closed gaps): `specialties.parent_id`, `districts.slug`.
- **Search:** tsvector kept `simple`/exact-token; trailing anusvara/visarga normalized in the Manglish dictionary. Full Malayalam stemming deferred.
- **Bonus:** clinic + diagnostic-centre listings (`facilities`, migration 0016) — spec line 13.

---

## Not done (Phase 2+)
- OTP/JWT auth, real session-based RBAC, `verified_by` capture.
- Facility profile pages (listings only for now).
- Full Malayalam text-search stemming.

**Tagged `v0.2.0-directory`** (2026-06-30). Auth-dependent partials (1.6 RBAC, 1.7 login) accepted as Phase 2 scope; encryption deviation and `app/` path accepted as permanent.
